# Quarantina

Quarantina is an emotional support bot crafted for your quarantine needs! QT checks up on you, asks you about your day, keeps you updated with all COVID-19 news and stats, recommends you music to lighten your mood and reminds you to stay strong everyday!

Unfortunately, we were unable to finish Quarantina on time. The bot works just fine on localhost, but after spending two whole days on trying to deploy it from heroku, failing and finally trying out azure's devops tools for deployment, it's static elements got deployed with ease, but the same can't be said for it's dynamic elements.

You can find out more about this bot at [devfolio](https://devfolio.co/submissions/quarantina), which is the bot was submitted after being made in the HackOn Hackathon!
