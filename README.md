<h2 align="center"><samp>The problem Quarantina solves</samp></h2>
Quarantina is an emotional support voice bot crafted for anyone's quarantine needs! Everything changed in an instant and this bot is made to cater to your current needs. QT checks up on you, asks you about your day, keeps you updated with all COVID-19 news and stats, recommends you music to lighten your mood, all while reminding you to stay strong every day.

<h2 align="center"><samp>Challenges we ran into</samp></h2>
We faced a lot of bugs. It was a bug fest. An exterminator would've been really helpful.

Jokes, aside, I was deadset on deploying the website on heroku and I went on that for two days before realising that I should stop breaking my head and use my brain. I ended up using Azure's pipeline for CI/CD, which was an extremely quick process in comparison.

Adding the webhooks to Dialogflow was extremely confusing and we were unable to integrate any of the apis we'd thought of using (IBM's Natural Language Understanding, The COVID-19 API by John Hopkin's university and Spotify's API).

Node and Express also gave loads of bugs, but they were pretty easy to figure out and solve.
